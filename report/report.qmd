### How to include sections separately
- You can use `{{include X}}` to include different sections of your report as separate `.qmd` files. This is also well documented in the Quarto documentation: <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/includes>

- As mentioned in the documentation, we have used (_) prefix for the included files (e.g., `_introduction.qmd` and `_data.qmd`). You should always use an underscore prefix with included files so that they are automatically ignored (i.e. not treated as standalone files) by a quarto render of a project (not absolutely necessary in your case, but highly recommended).

- Rendering only `report.qmd` will render also all the other files.
