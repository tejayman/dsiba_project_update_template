**Key Factors Contributing to Obesity**

This study offers a detailed analysis of the lifestyle and behavioral determinants of obesity within the context of Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, offering significant insights into the interplay of individual habits and environmental factors. The analysis identified family history of obesity as the most significant determinant, underscoring the combined influence of genetic predisposition and shared familial behaviors. This finding aligns with broader epidemiological evidence suggesting that intergenerational patterns, including both biological traits and familial lifestyle habits, substantially influence obesity risk.

Dietary practices were also particularly noticeable. The frequent consumption of high-calorie foods was positively associated with obesity, reinforcing as expected its well-documented role as a critical risk factor. Conversely, structured snacking appeared to exert a protective effect, suggesting that planned and balanced snack consumption might mitigate the risks posed by irregular, energy-dense eating patterns. Notably, these results emphasize that not all snacking behaviors are equally harmful, providing a nuanced perspective that may inform targeted dietary interventions.

Levels of physical activity emerged as a pivotal determinant, with higher activity levels associated with lower obesity risk. In this context, active transportation, including walking and cycling, demonstrated a particularly robust protective effect. Sedentary behaviors, such as prolonged use of technology, were strongly associated with higher obesity prevalence, likely reflecting a shift toward increasingly sedentary lifestyles in urbanized regions. Finally, inadequate vegetable consumption and low water intake compounded obesity risk, highlighting the cumulative effect of dietary quality and hydration on weight regulation.

These findings collectively illustrate the multifaceted nature of obesity within the given dataset, driven by an intricate interplay of hereditary, behavioral, and environmental factors. The results, while not directly generalizable to real-world settings due to the inherent nature of the data, emphasize the critical need for public health interventions tailored to the distinct sociocultural and environmental contexts of these regions.

**Predictive Modeling for Obesity Risk**

The study’s predictive modeling efforts centered on a logistic regression framework, systematically optimized through stepwise selection using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). This approach identified a subset of variables that most effectively predicted obesity outcomes while maintaining model parsimony and interpretability. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 75.89% and an AUC of 0.856, signifying strong performance in distinguishing between obese and non-obese individuals. High specificity (85.73%) indicated the model’s strength in correctly identifying non-obese individuals, while its sensitivity (67.30%) reflected moderate success in detecting true positive cases of obesity.

Key predictors included family history of obesity, dietary habits (notably, high-calorie food consumption and structured snacking), physical activity levels, and transportation modes. The inclusion of modifiable lifestyle variables highlights the model’s utility in informing targeted interventions. For example, individuals with higher obesity risk due to behavioral factors such as low physical activity or frequent consumption of high-calorie foods could be directed toward tailored public health programs aimed at mitigating these risks.

The model’s integration of behavioral data and its predictive accuracy suggest practical applications in population health management. By identifying individuals at elevated risk, resources can be prioritized toward preventive measures, including nutritional education, physical activity promotion, and family-centered interventions. Furthermore, the ability to quantify obesity risk based on modifiable factors provides actionable insights for developing evidence-based health policies.

## Final Thoughts and Proposals

This study has provided valuable insights into the determinants of obesity in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia by identifying critical behavioral and lifestyle factors. However, addressing certain limitations will be essential to strengthen the rigor and expand the scope of future research efforts. The exclusion of critical psychosocial, environmental, and cultural determinants—such as socioeconomic status, urban versus rural living conditions, and dietary norms—limits the explanatory power of the current model. Future studies should incorporate these variables to capture the complex interplay between contextual factors and obesity risk, thereby improving predictive accuracy. Additionally, the strong association between family history and obesity highlights the need to investigate intergenerational behavioral patterns and family dynamics, particularly as they relate to shared environmental and genetic factors. Longitudinal research is essential to disentangle causality, assess temporal trends, and evaluate the sustained impact of interventions, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of obesity progression over time.

From a public health perspective, the findings emphasize the necessity for integrated, multi-level interventions addressing both individual behaviors and broader systemic factors. Policies should prioritize active transportation initiatives, such as investments in pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, alongside public awareness campaigns to encourage physical activity as a routine part of daily life. For individuals with a family history of obesity, tailored interventions, including genetic risk counseling, family-based behavioral therapies, and parent-child lifestyle modification programs, should be prioritized to address both hereditary predispositions and modifiable risk factors.

Nutritional education efforts must target high-calorie food consumption, emphasizing balanced diets and structured snacking habits. Fiscal measures such as taxation of sugary beverages and processed foods, coupled with subsidies for fresh produce, represent economically viable approaches to incentivize healthier eating. Family-focused meal planning workshops and culturally sensitive dietary guidelines would further enhance the effectiveness of these interventions, directly addressing both immediate dietary behaviors and the intergenerational transmission of risk factors.

At the community level, expanding access to physical activity opportunities through well-maintained parks and public exercise facilities is critical in mitigating sedentary behaviors identified in the analysis. Initiatives such as family-friendly sports leagues or community exercise classes could foster collective engagement in healthier lifestyles. Workplace wellness programs promoting active breaks and nutritious meal options provide another avenue for reducing obesity prevalence. Furthermore, leveraging technology, such as culturally tailored mobile applications for dietary tracking, physical activity monitoring, and behavior modification, could empower individuals to adopt healthier routines. Incorporating family history as a personalized variable in these tools could help users understand their hereditary risks, facilitating tailored behavior change strategies.

These findings provide a compelling foundation for evidence-based public health policies targeting obesity in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia. By combining data-driven insights with culturally tailored interventions, this study supports the development of a comprehensive framework for addressing the multifaceted challenges of obesity. Future research should broaden the scope to include psychosocial and environmental determinants, employ longitudinal designs, and evaluate the scalability of interventions across diverse populations. Emphasizing early, family-centered approaches will be crucial in interrupting the cycle of intergenerational obesity, thereby promoting sustained health improvements for future generations.
