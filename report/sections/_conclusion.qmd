**Key Factors Contributing to Obesity**

This study offers a detailed analysis of the lifestyle and behavioral determinants of obesity within the context of Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, highlighting the interplay of individual habits and environmental factors. Family history of obesity emerged as the most significant determinant, underscoring the combined influence of genetic predisposition and shared familial behaviors, consistent with broader epidemiological evidence.

Dietary practices were particularly significant. Frequent consumption of high-calorie foods was strongly associated with obesity, reflecting its critical role as a risk factor (Rivera et al., 2004). In contrast, structured snacking appeared protective, suggesting that planned, balanced snacking might offset the risks of irregular, energy-dense eating patterns. These findings align with studies on dietary transitions in middle-income countries, where traditional diets are being replaced by processed, calorie-dense foods (Popkin et al., 2020).

Levels of physical activity also emerged as pivotal. Higher activity levels, particularly through active transportation like walking and cycling, were associated with lower obesity risk, highlighting the potential for low-cost, accessible interventions (Sallis et al., 2016). Conversely, sedentary behaviors, such as prolonged technology use, were linked to higher obesity prevalence. Finally, inadequate vegetable consumption and low water intake compounded obesity risk, emphasizing the cumulative effect of dietary quality and hydration on weight regulation.

These findings illustrate the multifaceted nature of obesity, driven by hereditary, behavioral, and environmental factors. They underscore the urgent need for tailored public health interventions suited to the sociocultural and environmental contexts of these regions.

**Predictive Modeling for Obesity Risk**

The study’s predictive modeling efforts centered on a logistic regression framework, systematically optimized through stepwise selection using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). This approach identified a subset of variables that most effectively predicted obesity outcomes while maintaining model parsimony and interpretability. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 75.89% and an AUC of 0.856, signifying strong performance in distinguishing between obese and non-obese individuals. High specificity (85.73%) indicated the model’s strength in correctly identifying non-obese individuals, while its sensitivity (67.30%) reflected moderate success in detecting true positive cases of obesity.

Key predictors included family history of obesity, dietary habits (notably, high-calorie food consumption and structured snacking), physical activity levels, and transportation modes. The inclusion of modifiable lifestyle variables highlights the model’s utility in informing targeted interventions. For example, individuals with higher obesity risk due to behavioral factors such as low physical activity or frequent consumption of high-calorie foods could be directed toward tailored public health programs aimed at mitigating these risks.

The model’s integration of behavioral data and its predictive accuracy suggest practical applications in population health management. By identifying individuals at elevated risk, resources can be prioritized toward preventive measures, including nutritional education, physical activity promotion, and family-centered interventions. Furthermore, the ability to quantify obesity risk based on modifiable factors provides actionable insights for developing evidence-based health policies.

## Final Thoughts and Proposals

This study has provided valuable insights into the determinants of obesity in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia by identifying critical behavioral and lifestyle factors. However, addressing certain limitations will be essential to strengthen the rigor and expand the scope of future research efforts. The exclusion of critical psychosocial, environmental, and cultural determinants—such as socioeconomic status, urban versus rural living conditions, and dietary norms—limits the explanatory power of the current model. Future studies should incorporate these variables to capture the complex interplay between contextual factors and obesity risk, thereby improving predictive accuracy. Additionally, the strong association between family history and obesity highlights the need to investigate family behavior trends, particularly as they relate to shared environmental and genetic factors. Longitudinal research is essential to understand cause-and-effect relationships, assess temporal trends, and evaluate the sustained impact of interventions, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of obesity progression over time.

From a public health perspective, the findings emphasize the necessity for integrated, multi-level interventions addressing both individual behaviors and wider influences. Policies should prioritize active transportation initiatives, such as investments in pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, alongside public awareness campaigns to encourage physical activity as a routine part of daily life. For individuals with a family history of obesity, tailored interventions, including genetic risk counseling, family-based behavioral therapies, and parent-child lifestyle modification programs, should be prioritized to address both hereditary predispositions and modifiable risk factors.

Nutritional education efforts must target high-calorie food consumption, emphasizing balanced diets and structured snacking habits. Fiscal measures such as taxation of sugary beverages and processed foods, coupled with subsidies for fresh produce, represent economically viable approaches to incentivize healthier eating. Family-focused meal planning workshops and culturally sensitive dietary guidelines would further enhance the effectiveness of these interventions, directly addressing both immediate dietary behaviors and the intergenerational transmission of risk factors.

At the community level, expanding access to physical activity opportunities through well-maintained parks and public exercise facilities is critical in mitigating sedentary behaviors identified in the analysis. Initiatives such as family-friendly sports leagues or community exercise classes could foster collective engagement in healthier lifestyles. Workplace wellness programs promoting active breaks and nutritious meal options provide another avenue for reducing obesity prevalence. Furthermore, leveraging technology, such as culturally specific mobile applications for dietary tracking, physical activity monitoring, and behavior modification, could empower individuals to adopt healthier routines. Incorporating family history as a personalized variable in these tools could help users understand their hereditary risks, facilitating tailored behavior change strategies.

These findings provide a compelling foundation for evidence-based public health policies targeting obesity in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia. By combining data-driven insights with culturally custom solutions, this study supports the development of a comprehensive framework for addressing the multifaceted challenges of obesity. Future research should broaden the scope to include psychosocial and environmental determinants, employ longitudinal designs, and evaluate the scalability of interventions across diverse populations. Emphasizing early, family-centered approaches will be crucial in interrupting the cycle of intergenerational obesity, thereby promoting sustained health improvements for future generations.
