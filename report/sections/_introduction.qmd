# Introduction

## Project Goals

Obesity has emerged as one of the most pressing global health crises, with its prevalence nearly tripling worldwide since 1975, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). This alarming trend has fueled a dramatic rise in obesity-related diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, and hypertension, imposing significant burdens on healthcare systems and economies. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the situation is particularly concerning: as of 2022, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) reported that nearly 25% of adults in the region are affected by obesity, emphasizing the urgent need for effective public health interventions. The crisis is especially acute in the countries central to this research. In 2018, Mexico recorded an adult obesity rate of 36.1%, while Peru and Colombia reported similarly worrisome rates of approximately 28% and 23%, respectively.

This widespread prevalence underscores the critical need for research focused on understanding and addressing the multifaceted factors contributing to obesity. In this context, the present study adopts an exploratory and primarily educational approach to examine the relationships between dietary habits, physical activity, and demographic variables, aiming to uncover their impact on obesity levels in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia. By leveraging a dataset consisting of 77% synthetically generated data (produced via the SMOTE algorithm) and 23% user-collected data from 498 participants, the research seeks to provide meaningful insights into this complex issue.

While the reliance on synthetic data and a non-representative sample limits direct real-world applicability, this study offers a unique opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge gained during the "Data Science in Business Analytics" course to a simulated scenario. By identifying patterns, correlations, and potential predictors of obesity, the research highlights the importance of data-driven approaches in addressing significant public health challenges. Ultimately, the findings aim to lay the groundwork for future studies and contribute to the development of informed public health strategies and healthcare policies, demonstrating the transformative potential of data analytics in managing and mitigating complex issues.

## Research Questions

-   **Question 1**

    What are the key lifestyle and behavioral factors that significantly contribute to obesity in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia?

-   **Question 2**

    Can we predict whether a person will be obese based on some given combinations of factors?

-   **Question 3**
