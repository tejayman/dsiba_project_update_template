# Introduction

Obesity has become a major global health issue, with its prevalence tripling since 1975. According to the WHO, 1.9 billion adults were overweight in 2022, with over 650 million classified as obese. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the problem is particularly pressing: as of 2022, 25% of adults were obese, with rates reaching 36.1% in Mexico and around 28% and 23% in Peru and Colombia, respectively. These alarming trends contribute to rising cases of obesity-related diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular issues. This project, using data from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia—77% of which is synthetically generated via SMOTE and 23% collected from 498 participants online—seeks to explore how lifestyle factors contribute to obesity in these regions. While the synthetic nature of the data limits real-world applicability, this scenario allows for the practical application of concepts from the "Data Science in Business Analytics" course, enabling us to identify key patterns in dietary habits and physical activity that contribute to obesity.

Our primary goal is to identify the most significant behavioral factors contributing to obesity in these countries by conducting exploratory analyses on lifestyle patterns and building a regression and a predictive model based on factors like diet, activity level, and demographics. Visualizations will also be developed to illustrate findings and relationships clearly, enhancing stakeholder understanding of the insights derived. Although synthetic data limits the findings' applicability, this exercise provides valuable training in data analysis techniques and the potential insights obtainable from comprehensive, real-world data.

The main research questions this project addresses include identifying which lifestyle factors significantly impact obesity in these regions and exploring whether obesity can be predicted based on these factors. By focusing on key lifestyle elements—diet and physical activity—that influence obesity, the data used is tailored to the cultural contexts of Mexico, Peru, and Colombia. Through these insights, we aim to inform public health initiatives, providing actionable data for healthcare organizations and policymakers to address the growing obesity crisis effectively.
