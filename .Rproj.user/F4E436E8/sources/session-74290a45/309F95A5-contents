In the present analytical endeavor, we plan to employe a regression model approach to elucidate the intricate dynamics between a set of independent variables, which serve as the predictors, and Obesity Level as a singular dependent variable which is the outcome.

The rationale behind the selection of regression modeling stems from its established robustness as a statistical methodology, particularly adept at unraveling and quantifying the interrelations among variables. This is paramount, considering our overarching objective to forecast outcomes and to meticulously evaluate the repercussions that alterations in the predictor variables may have on the target variable.

Based on our exploratory data analysis, indications of potential outliers emerged within our dataset. However, upon closer examination, these values represent extreme data points that remain plausible given the context of our study. Consequently, our approach involves building two regression models: one that includes these extreme values and one that excludes them. The objective is to examine the impact of these extreme data points on the predictive performance of the model, analyzing how their presence or absence influences the resulting predictions and model behavior.

The idea behind the adoption of regression analysis is twofold. Firstly, it affords a nuanced understanding of the extent to which each predictor influences the outcome. Secondly, it provides a suite of statistical metrics that facilitate the evaluation of the model's capacity to elucidate the variance in the data. Through regression analysis, we can ascertain the presence of statistically significant linkages between the variables under scrutiny and quantify the magnitude and trajectory of these associations. This method endows us with coefficients that reflect the anticipated alteration in the dependent variable corresponding to a unit change in the predictors, whilst controlling for the constancy of other variables. That answers the first part of our research question. In top of that the regression model will permit us to ascertain the extent to which our independent variables account for the variability observed in the dependent variable (Assess Predictive Power), but we also will be able to delineate the individual impact magnitudes exerted by each predictor variable and to validate the statistical significance of these effects(Quantify Effects:).

At last, by integrating pertinent covariates and control variables into the model, we aim to attenuate biases and segregate the influence of the primary predictors on the outcome, thereby enhancing the accuracy of our findings.By looking at R², the P-values and the standardized coefficients we should be able to understand what are the key factors that can influence the weight condition of a person( obesity level).

To ensure the performance of the model we will need to check the linearity between the values, the normality of residuals and the homogeneity of Variance. And lastly we will check which non significant variable Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is a statistical measure used to detect multicollinearity in a regression model. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables in a model are highly correlated, meaning they contain redundant information. High multicollinearity can distort the estimates of coefficients, making it difficult to interpret the individual effect of each predictor.

We also want to build a predictive model. The EDA and the regression model will likely show that some of the key factors of our dataset are useful to make prediction about the type of weight someone will have. Once we identified relationships within our data, we aim to make reliable predictions about future outcomes. the regression will also help us understand which variables have the most significant impact on obesity level. And by using other statistical metrics Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R², we will assess how well the model performs and refine it as needed to improve accuracy.
